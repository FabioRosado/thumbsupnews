After releasing the report, Horowitz said that he would conduct a further investigation to see if the errors identified in the Page application were widespread.“The concern is that this is such a high-profile, important case. If it happened here, is this indicative of a wider problem — and we will only know that when we complete our audit — or is it isolated to this event?” Horowitz told lawmakers during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing. “Obviously, we need to do the work to understand that.”Horowitz’s office said in a report released Tuesday that of the 29 applications — all of which involved U.S. citizens – that were pulled from “8 FBI field offices of varying sizes,” the FBI could not find Woods Files for four of the applications, while the other 25 all had “apparent errors or inadequately supported facts.”&quot;While our review of these issues and follow-up with case agents is still ongoing—and we have not made materiality judgments for these or other errors or concerns we identified—at this time we have identified an average of about 20 issues per application reviewed, with a high of approximately 65 issues in one application and less than 5 issues in another application,&quot; the report reveals.The Woods Procedure dictates that the Justice Department verify the accuracy and provide evidentiary support for all facts stated in its FISA application. The FBI is required to share with the FISA Court all relevant information compiled in the Woods File when applying for a surveillance warrant.“FBI and NSD officials we interviewed indicated to us that there were no efforts by the FBI to use existing FBI and NSD oversight mechanisms to perform comprehensive, strategic assessments of the efficacy of the Woods Procedures or FISA accuracy, to include identifying the need for enhancements to training and improvements in the process, or increased accountability measures,” the report states.The OIG concludes by recommending that the FBI &quot;systematically and regularly examine the results of past and future accuracy reviews to identify patterns or trends in identified errors&quot; relating to the Woods Procedure, as well as double-checking &quot;that Woods Files exist for every FISA application submitted to the FISC in all pending investigations.&quot;In a letter acknowledging the audit, FBI Associate Deputy Director Paul Abbate said that the issues &quot;will be addressed&quot; by the Bureau&#39;s already-issued correctives after the Carter Page review, and added that &quot;the FBI fully accepts the two recommendations.&quot;President Trump has relentlessly attacked the FBI&#39;s FISA process and the abuses it allowed during the surveilling of his 2016 campaign. He has argued that the FISA abuses invalidate the entire investigation, which he has referred to as an “illegal attempted coup,” and slammed the officials involved, including former FBI director James Comey and former acting FBI director Andy McCabe.McCabe admitted in January that the FBI has an “inherent weakness in the process” of obtaining FISA warrants.<p><br clear=\"all\">", "date": "Tue, 31 Mar 2020 11:13:29 -0400", "categories": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"], "source": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"]}

Gomez, 19, confessed to authorities that he attempted to murder three Asian-American family members, including the toddler and a 6-year-old, on March 14 at the Midland, Texas store, according to the Midland Police Department. Gomez, who stabbed the individuals and a Sam’s Club employee, is now facing several charges, including three counts of attempted capital murder and one count of aggravated assault. He is being held on several bonds totaling $1 million.“The suspect indicated that he stabbed the family because he thought the family was Chinese, and infecting people with coronavirus,” according to an FBI analysis report obtained by ABC News.Inside the Ugly Uber and Lyft Driver Freakout Over CoronavirusThe Texas incident was used in the report as one example of a recent surge in hate crimes and racially fueled violence targeting Asian-Americans as the coronavirus pandemic continues to sweep the United States. According to an arrest affidavit obtained by the Midland Reporter-Telegram, Gomez attempted to kill the Asian-American family of four inside the wholesale store at about 7:30 p.m. When a Sam’s Club employee and another patron intervened, Gomez allegedly stabbed the patron in the leg and fingers with a knife. At one point, the customer was able to knock the knife away from Gomez during the struggle before the teenager was finally subdued by Border Patrol Agent Bernie Ramiez, who was off-duty and just leaving the store after shopping for groceries, the affidavit states.Ramirez later told CBS7 that during the altercation, he saw the store employee had managed to put Gomez in a chokehold after he had stabbed multiple people.“My initial thought was it was just the shortage of items that they were fighting over,” Ramirez told the local outlet. “So I just started making my way over there to break it up.”The agent added, “I’ve got close to 19 years in law enforcement. It’s crazy and it’s sad the way certain individuals think, their mindset. It’s a sad deal.”When authorities arrived at the Sam’s Club, investigators immediately began to question Gomez. The teenager then admitted to trying to kill the family and assaulting the patron with a knife, the affidavit states. Ramirez did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment and a spokesperson for Midland Mayor Patrick Payton’s office declined to comment, stating that the case has now been turned over to the FBI. According to the intelligence report that was compiled by the FBI’s Houston office and distributed to local law enforcement agencies across the nation, federal officials believe hate crimes will only increase as COVID-19 continues to spread.‘We’re Scared’: Doctors in New Coronavirus Hotspots Brace for ‘Tsunami’ of Patients“The FBI assesses hate crime incidents against Asian Americans likely will surge across the United States, due to the spread of coronavirus disease... endangering Asian American communities,” the report states. “The FBI makes this assessment based on the assumption that a portion of the US public will associate COVID-19 with China and Asian American populations.”To date, more than 3,416 people have died and 174,467 individuals have been infected with the virus nationwide—a death toll that has eclipsed China’s official count and put much of the United States on lockdown.Since then, several political and media commentators, including President Donald Trump, have adopted the practice of calling the pandemic the “China virus” or the “Wuhan virus.”“It did come from China,” Trump said at a March 19 White House briefing. “It is a very accurate term.”Many experts and political figures believe that officials using racial terms for the virus has contributed to discrimination against members of the Asian-American community. “This is a global emergency that should be met with both urgency and also cultural awareness that COVID-19 is not isolated to a single ethnic population,” Jeffrey Caballero, executive director of the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations, said in a statement to The Daily Beast. “Xenophobic attacks and discrimination towards Asian American communities are unacceptable and will not make our families safer or healthier.”California Gov. Gavin Newsom reiterated the FBI’s report findings, stating he has seen a “huge increase” in assaults targeting the Asian-American community in his state. In New York, Attorney General Leticia James launched a hotline for victims of coronavirus-related bias crimes. Since the surge, even Trump tried to backtrack on his language, tweeting on March 23, “It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world. They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER!”‘This Is a War’: Cuomo Pleads for Help From Doctors Across U.S. as Coronavirus Death Toll SurgesAccording to one New York City medical social worker, racism is also rampant in the health-care system as Asian-American doctors and nurses struggle to care for patients who don’t want to be touched. “I get yelled at down the street coming into work from people in their cars saying all these really nasty things and telling me I should be punished for bringing the virus here,” the social worker told The Daily Beast last week. “Inside the hospital, I have heard from several Asian-American doctors and nurses that some patients don’t want to be treated by them because they think they already have the virus. It’s like we are the virus or something.”“It’s scary and it’s dangerous. We’re already putting ourselves on the line to help others. Don’t make it harder for us than it is,” she added. Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast hereGet our top stories in your inbox every day.

Cases Jump Overnight\" align=\"left\" title=\"Cuomo Says Coronavirus Is ‘More Dangerous’ Than We Thought as N.Y. Cases Jump Overnight\" border=\"0\" ></a>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday acknowledged that the coronavirus is “more dangerous” than officials initially thought after more than 300 died across the state overnight.“I’m tired of being behind this virus. We’ve been behind this virus from day one,” Cuomo said at a Tuesday press conference in Albany. “We underestimated this virus. It’s more powerful, it’s more dangerous than we expected.” More than 1,500 people have died and 75,795 more have been infected with the virus in New York State, accounting for a 14 percent increase in the last 24 hours, Cuomo said. About 43,139 of those cases are in New York City, where the daily number of newly infected patients has fortunately dipped below 6,000 across the five boroughs over the last 24 hours.To date, more than 3,416 people have died and 174,467 individuals have been infected with the virus nationwide—a death toll that has eclipsed China’s official count.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Implements ‘Stay at Home’ Order Amid Coronavirus PandemicCuomo said it could be weeks before New York sees the worst of the pandemic, stating that the apex may not be for 21 days. “We’re all anxious, we’re all tired, we’re all fatigued. It’s been all bad news for a long time. Our whole lifestyle has been disrupted. Everybody wants to know one thing, when will it end. Nobody knows,” Cuomo said. “We’re dealing with a war we’ve never dealt with before. We need a totally different mindset and organizational transformation.”  New York City’s hospitals have been struggling over the last week to keep up with the influx of patients. With over 10,900 residents hospitalized with the virus, including 2,700 patients in ICUs, Cuomo said that the health-care system still needs more supplies, space, and personnel. The state has ordered 17,000 ventilators from China to help hospitals, paying about $25,000 per machine.“It’s like being on Ebay with 50 other states bidding on a ventilator. How inefficient,” Cuomo said, noting that he only expects to receive about 2,500 machines from China because other states, the federal government, and Italy have also placed orders from the foreign government. “And then FEMA gets involved and FEMA starts bidding. And now FEMA is bidding on top of the 50. So FEMA is driving up the price. What sense does this make?” Cuomo asked.‘This Is a War’: Cuomo Pleads for Help From Doctors Across U.S. as Coronavirus Death Toll SurgesTo further combat the shortage, Cuomo reiterated his Monday plea to health-care workers across the United States for help with the increasing number of infected patients, promising the Empire State would return the favor whenever it’s over the “bell curve.” The governor said that while the state is working to get ahead of the virus, several projections indicate the “main battle at the apex” will occur anywhere between one week and 21 days from now. “We’re still going up the mountain,&quot; Cuomo said, adding that New York is struggling to curtail the surge and “you don’t win by playing catch up.”  “The main battle is at the top of the mountain, the apex of the curve.”So far, government officials have already taken extraordinary steps to combat the pandemic. On Monday, local officials opened the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center as a makeshift, 3,000-bed overflow hospital facility. The same day, a naval hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, arrived in Manhattan to help relieve hospitals of patients not infected with the virus. The ship, which was previously used as a floating base for rescue workers after 9/11, is currently equipped with 1,000 beds, 12 operating rooms, a medical laboratory, and over 1,000 officers.Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, in conjunction with a Christian aid organization, also converted a section of Central Park into a field hospital to help house the influx of COVID-19 patients. The tent-hospital, which holds 68 regular hospital beds, along with 10 ICU beds, opened on Tuesday.Despite the emergency steps that have already been taken, the chair of the department of surgery at Columbia University said Monday the toll of the virus at New York City hospitals is getting so serious that medical professionals could soon be forced to decide who gets treatment—and who doesn’t.One Mask Only: Coronavirus Docs and Nurses Forced to Make Terrifying CompromisesAccording to Dr. Craig Smith, the apex of the virus will be too overwhelming for the amount of beds currently in New York, forcing doctors and nurses to shift to using a triage method as a “fundamental operating principle in field hospitals.”“Triage determines who should be treated first, how they should be treated (surgery, fluid resuscitation, etc), and who should be kept comfortable,” Smith said in an update to Columbia faculty and staff about the pandemic response. “Broadly construed, we will all be operating more and more on field hospital principles as we move through the next few weeks.”NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Smith said, will have to “carefully ” select which COVID-19 patients to send home with oxygen, an oxygen saturation monitor, and a strict follow-up system. “Does this entail incompletely understood risk? It certainly does, but triage is an essential part of the resource/utility-balancing situation in which we find ourselves,” he said.The devastating effects of the pandemic in New York have rippled from health care to law enforcement. New York City Police Commissioner Dermont Shea said Tuesday that the virus has greatly affected the city’s law enforcement, as approximately 15 percent of the 37,000-member force has called out sick. NYC Is on the Brink as Patients Flood Hospitals Already ‘Under Siege’“We have the reserves, we have the contingency plans,” Shea said, stating that while about 5,500 officers are out sick, the NYPD is not extending shifts. He added that 17 NYPD members who tested positive for COVID-19 have since recovered.Seeming to take a jab at President Donald Trump’s failed prediction that the United States would be able to return to normal life by April 21, Cuomo later emphasized that it is unclear when things in his state will return to normal.“It is not going to be soon,” he said, urging residents to stay home and stressing there will not be “an Easter surprise.” “So calibrate yourself and your expectations, so you’re not disappointed every morning you get up.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

A breakthrough seems unlikely with President Donald Trump asking for as much as a five-fold increase and South Korea showing no signs of paying anywhere near that much.The furloughs, which the Hankyoreh newspaper said would be the first of their kind, will put new pressure on an alliance that Trump has repeatedly criticized since taking office three years ago. The move comes as the U.S. military struggles to keep coronavirus outbreaks from disrupting operations in South Korea and elsewhere and the allies watch for fresh provocations from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.The two sides have been deadlocked over what’s known as the Special Measures Agreement, with Trump initially demanding about $5 billion a year from South Korea to pay for U.S. security. South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s administration has indicated that it wouldn’t pay much more than the almost $1 billion it agreed to in a one-year stopgap deal in 2019.South Korea’s lead negotiator, Jeong Eun-bo, said in a statement Tuesday that the two sides were in the “final steps” of negotiations and expressed regret that the U.S. government went ahead with the furlough.“If the Trump administration persists in holding to this level of unreasonable demands it will seriously damage the reliability and credibility of our security alliance,” said Daniel Sneider, a lecturer in international policy at Stanford University who has written about how Japanese and Koreans view their shared history. “It feeds a strain of Korean nationalism that would want to effectively end the alliance and perhaps bring Korea, de facto, under the security umbrella of China.”In the short term, the furloughs of workers, who provide services ranging from security to manning food stations, could mean further disruptions to daily life on bases that serve some 28,000 U.S. service personnel in South Korea. In the longer term, the dispute could accelerate a realignment of an alliance that the U.S. relies on to check China, as well as North Korea.Trump has repeatedly insisted that the U.S. gets a raw deal from partners who host American troops around the world, and he’s focused particular ire on the South Korean agreement. Last month, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told his counterpart, Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo, that “as a global economic powerhouse and an equal partner in the preservation of peace on the peninsula, South Korea can and should contribute more to its defense.”South Korea’s National Assembly must sign off on any deal and Trump’s demands have brought about a rare moment of unity from progressives and conservatives in the country who see them as unreasonable. With parliamentary elections set for April 15, siding with Washington could lead to defeat at the ballot box.Missiles Fly“We are currently trying our best to ensure our joint defense posture goes unhindered as well to protect our Korean workers,” South Korean Defense Ministry spokeswoman Choi Hyun-soo said. The USFK Korean Employees Union, which represents the workers, said in a statement last week that negotiations “cannot end with the way the U.S. government and President Trump wants.”Negotiators from the U.S. and South Korea met earlier this month in Los Angeles but a wide gap remains between the two sides, according to a State Department spokesman who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. The official said that South Korea will need to show more focus and flexibility to reach a deal, without specifying what the U.S. is asking or what South Korea is offering.While the U.S. and South Korea have been bargaining, North Korea has been busy testing new types of solid-fuel, nuclear-capable ballistic missiles designed to strike anywhere on the peninsula and evade U.S. interceptors. It has fired off at least nine in March alone, a record for a month.Kim warned on Dec. 31 that bigger provocations could soon come, saying he was no longer bound by a previous promise to halt testing of nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. On Monday, a top diplomat was quoted in a state media report issuing a new threat, saying Secretary of State Michael Pompeo’s pressure campaign against Pyongyang will result in North Korea looking “to repay the U.S. with actual horror and unrest for the sufferings it has inflicted upon our people.”North Korea Fires Missiles Off Its East Coast; 4th Volley This Month The negotiations in South Korea could affect other U.S. allies hosting troops, such as Japan, with Esper saying the Trump administration wants them to pay more, too. Japanese officials are watching the South Korea negotiations closely with the approach of talks set to begin later this year for a U.S-Japan cost-sharing deal.Daniel Pinkston, a lecturer in international relations at Troy University in Seoul and a former Korean linguist with the U.S. Air Force, said the difficulty in reaching a troop-funding deal “sends the wrong signal to allies, competitors, and challengers who must be questioning U.S. commitments and resolve.”“It increases the likelihood of miscalculation, arms-racing, WMD proliferation, and even armed conflict,” Pinkston said.(Updates with South Korean statement in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=\"all\">", "date": "Tue, 31 Mar 2020 06:00:22 -0400", "categories": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"], "source": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"]}

The government will also unveil additional stimulus measures to boost the economy early next week.The action comes as confirmed cases of local transmission and unlinked infections in the country have risen in recent weeks. “We have decided that instead of tightening incrementally over the next few weeks, we should make a decisive move now, to preempt escalating infections,” said Lee.Singapore’s tougher moves signal its current approach -- relying on contact tracing, strict containment measures such as shutting bars, and quarantine -- is no longer tenable. While more than 160 countries have already shut schools, the city-state was one of a handful that did not do so, citing early research that children are not as affected as adults.Here are other details of the stricter measures:Casinos, theme parks to close starting next week.Food establishments, markets and supermarkets, clinics, hospitals, utilities, transport and key banking services will remain open.From April 7, all restaurants, hawker centers, coffee shops, food courts and other food-and-beverage outlets will remain open only for takeaway or delivery.Other economic sectors “that are strategic, or form part of a global supply chain” will not be closed.All preschool and student care centers will be closed, but will provide limited services for children of parents who have to continue working and are unable to make alternative arrangements.Government will stop discouraging the general public from wearing face masks in public, and will distribute reusable masks from April 5.The government also plans on Monday to announce more support aimed at businesses and households. Singapore delivered a second stimulus package worth S$48 billion ($33.4 billion) last week to fight the outbreak, drawing on national reserves for the first time since the global financial crisis to support an economy heading for recession.“Even if more assistance measures are announced on Monday, they are unlikely to offset the economic ramifications of what is akin to an economic immobilization,” Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore, said in an email. Retail sales plunged 8.6% in February from the same time last year, marking the worst decrease since June and the 13th consecutive decline.‘Very Worrying’ TrendsLee said the spirit of these measures is to get people to minimize physical contact. “If we don’t go out, if we avoid contact with others, then the virus won’t be able to spread. It is as simple as that,” he said.Lawrence Wong, minister for national development who co-chairs a task force to fight the virus, said in a press conference the increase in the number of local and unlinked coronavirus cases are “very, very worrying trends.”The latest set of moves will continue for at least a month, Wong said, adding there’s a chance the government can roll back the measures by the end of the month if the guidelines are upheld. He said the key objective is to reduce the spread of the virus, particularly cutting the number of unlinked cases.“If there’s poor compliance, poor implementation, then we have to be prepared for these measures to continue,” Wong said. “Let’s hunker down and beat the virus together.”Singapore announced Friday a fifth person has died due to complications from the coronavirus. Cases have risen more sharply in March compared to earlier months, and now total more than 1,000.Health Minister Gan said the city-state has yet to reach its highest level of alert, so-called Dorscon Red, and would press on with contact-tracing and widespread efforts to contain the disease. “We’re not yet in Dorscon Red, and we’re quite a distance from Dorscon Red,” he said.(Updates to add detail on prior approach in first, fourth paragraphs)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=\"all\">", "date": "Fri, 03 Apr 2020 08:42:37 -0400", "categories": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"], "source": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"], "sentiment": "positive"}

That is our near-term priority. As the administration has made clear, going to your current lending bank is the fastest route.”The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company had staff working overnight Thursday to prepare for expected high volumes of applications Friday. The initiative is part of the $2.2 trillion government stimulus package and is aimed at helping small businesses survive the devastating impact of the pandemic.“We’re setting up shop and activating thousands of people to be able to take the applications,” Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said in an interview Wednesday on Bloomberg Television. The bank has been heavily involved in talks with the White House and Treasury on the program, he said.On Thursday, the Small Business Administration bumped up to 1% the interest rate lenders may charge small businesses after banks complained that the previous approved rate of 0.5% was below even their own cost of funds.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza released additional guidelines for the program just a few hours before it’s expected to become widely available Friday.“This is a very important program,” Mnuchin said in a news conference Thursday. “Please bring your workers back to work if you’ve let them go.”(Updates with Mnuchin’s comment in last paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=\"all\">", "date": "Fri, 03 Apr 2020 08:33:50 -0400", "categories": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"], "source": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"], "sentiment": "positive"}

Suddenly, the protests in Hong Kong, carrying a mortal threat to political stability in the mainland, became a physical impossibility. More important, the pandemic set in motion a global competition, to contain the virus, for which China and the Chinese Communist Party seem uniquely prepared.As the virus spread to the whole world, it became apparent that Western societies — Beijing’s true rivals — did not have the ability to quickly organize every citizen around a single goal. As opposed to China, which remains to a large extent a revolutionary society, their political systems were built for normal times. Chinese society is a mobilized army, which can quickly drop everything else and march in one direction.Mao once said, “Everything under heaven is in utter chaos, the situation is excellent.” And so it seems at present, as seen from Beijing. Chinese diplomats stationed all over the world spend their time raising the stakes to a dangerous level. Following instructions from the very top, they have taken to the media to issue a challenge to America, to point out its failure, and to compare the chaos in American cities and hospitals with what they see as a singular success in stopping the epidemic in China.Several commentators have suggested that China may be winning the coronavirus battle by stepping forward in providing medical help to affected countries, mostly in Europe, at a time when the United States is consumed with its own difficulties. This misses the point.The cases have been multiplying where the medical equipment provided by Chinese companies and even the Chinese state turned out to be faulty, provoking justified ire in, for example, Spain, the Netherlands, and Turkey. Moreover, medical help is a normal occurrence in a crisis. China has done nothing different, except perhaps in the clumsy way it publicizes those efforts.Forget about “mask diplomacy.” It is no more than a distraction. There are other ways for China to use the coronavirus pandemic to upturn the existing global order. I see three main levers.The first one is the direct comparison between the situation in China and elsewhere. The numbers of cases and fatalities provided by Chinese authorities almost certainly misrepresent the real figures by more than an order of magnitude, but the fact remains that a semblance of normalcy was achieved in a small period of time. If the United States fails to do the same, its prestige will suffer a severe blow. People all over the world will quickly change their perceptions about relative power and capacity.The second lever resides with industrial value chains. Last month General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler closed all their automotive production plants across the United States and Canada. Other sectors have followed. In the meantime, China contained the worst of the pandemic to one province, allowing economic activity to quickly resume elsewhere. The most recent data show renewed activity in the flow of goods across the country, as well as at ports worldwide that do business with China. If the freeze in Europe and America continues for much longer, Chinese companies will be able to dramatically expand market share and replace Western-led value chains. Just yesterday Chinese authorities announced that manufacturing activity expanded in March, defying expectations of a contraction. In February the official Purchasing Managers’ Index hit a record low of 35.7. It bounced back to 52.0 in March. Prepare for a worldwide wave of Chinese acquisitions at knockdown prices.Finally, in a more extreme scenario, important countries could experience the kind of economic shock that leads to widespread social and political collapse. At that point, China would have a unique opportunity to step in, provide aid, and refashion these countries in its image. It would look like a repeat of the Marshall Plan and the beginning of the American world order after the ravages of World War II. Indonesia, South Asia, and even Russia might be of special interest in such a scenario.We knew that a generalized race or competition between alternative geopolitical models had started, but it was never clear what the background for such a competition would be. If the clash took place within the existing global trade and financial system, which was of course built according to Western rules and principles, the United States was confident the battle could be decisively won. But what if it took place on neutral ground? What if it took place in a kind of neutral landscape, a state of nature with few or no rules, against a chaotic and quickly evolving background? The outcome would become considerably more uncertain.To put it more bluntly: There was always an argument that the existing world order cannot change because only a momentous war has done that in the past and world wars have become impossible. But in pandemics — and soon in climate change — we may have found two functional equivalents of war.<p><br clear=\"all\">", "date": "Fri, 03 Apr 2020 06:30:22 -0400", "categories": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"], "source": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"], "sentiment": "positive"}

The pandemic has killed 181 people in Indonesia, surpassing South Korea’s total of 174, data compiled by the Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins University showed.Indonesian President Joko Widodo declared a national health emergency this week and ordered large scale social distancing to contain the spread of the virus that’s killed more than 53,000 people worldwide. The world’s fourth-most populous nation, along with India and the Philippines, could soon become the next Covid-19 hot spots given their large populations, weak health care infrastructure and social security net, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.Jokowi, as Widodo is commonly known, has rejected calls to lock down cities and regions to fight the virus, saying such harsh steps would hurt the poor the most. But the surge in cases has overwhelmed the country’s health care system, with authorities struggling to procure enough personal protection equipment, hazmat suits and ventilators for medical workers.The highest mortality rate in Asia at above 9% may signal the actual number of infections may be much higher than reported, reflecting a lack of COVID-19 testing capacity, according to Nomura. The country may eventually be forced to implement a complete lockdown in April and possibly for an extended period, Nomura said in a report Friday.“We think Indonesia has been the slowest in terms of taking decisive measures and is therefore most at risk of delays in containing the outbreak within its borders, with larger negative economic consequences,” Nomura analysts led by Sonal Varma said in the report. “An immediate concern is the upcoming holidays, which risk increasing transmission due to the surge in domestic travel.”Fears of the pandemic spreading to the vast archipelago have mounted with the government deciding not to ban the annual ritual of millions of Indonesians traveling to their hometowns or villages when the Muslim-majority nation celebrates Eid al-Fitr at the end of the fasting month of Ramdan. Jokowi, who on Thursday urged people to avoid travel and practice social distancing to prevent the virus, has ordered several income support measures for daily wage earners, informal sector workers and street hawkers.The government has also vowed to do whatever it takes to limit the damage to Southeast Asia’s biggest economy from the pandemic, by allocating 405 trillion rupiah ($25 billion) to support the health system and the economy. It has also temporarily scrapped a budget deficit cap of 3% of gross domestic product to allow government to boost spending.Authorities are scrambling to stabilize the economy and financial markets amid a sell-off in emerging markets, which has led to a 16% plunge in the rupiah against the dollar so far this year. With the pandemic taking a toll, it is projected to grow just 2.3% this year, compared to an initial estimate of 5.3%, and could even contract 0.4% in a worst-case scenario.(Updates with comment from analysts in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=\"all\">", "date": "Fri, 03 Apr 2020 07:30:32 -0400", "categories": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"], "source": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"], "sentiment": "negative"}

If the freeze in Europe and America continues for much longer, Chinese companies will be able to dramatically expand market share and replace Western-led value chains. Just yesterday Chinese authorities announced that manufacturing activity expanded in March, defying expectations of a contraction. In February the official Purchasing Managers’ Index hit a record low of 35.7. It bounced back to 52.0 in March. Prepare for a worldwide wave of Chinese acquisitions at knockdown prices.Finally, in a more extreme scenario, important countries could experience the kind of economic shock that leads to widespread social and political collapse. At that point, China would have a unique opportunity to step in, provide aid, and refashion these countries in its image. It would look like a repeat of the Marshall Plan and the beginning of the American world order after the ravages of World War II. Indonesia, South Asia, and even Russia might be of special interest in such a scenario.We knew that a generalized race or competition between alternative geopolitical models had started, but it was never clear what the background for such a competition would be. If the clash took place within the existing global trade and financial system, which was of course built according to Western rules and principles, the United States was confident the battle could be decisively won. But what if it took place on neutral ground? What if it took place in a kind of neutral landscape, a state of nature with few or no rules, against a chaotic and quickly evolving background? The outcome would become considerably more uncertain.To put it more bluntly: There was always an argument that the existing world order cannot change because only a momentous war has done that in the past and world wars have become impossible. But in pandemics — and soon in climate change — we may have found two functional equivalents of war.<p><br clear=\"all\">", "date": "Fri, 03 Apr 2020 06:30:22 -0400", "categories": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"], "source": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"], "sentiment": "positive"}

The government will also unveil additional stimulus measures to boost the economy early next week.The action comes as confirmed cases of local transmission and unlinked infections in the country have risen in recent weeks. “We have decided that instead of tightening incrementally over the next few weeks, we should make a decisive move now, to preempt escalating infections,” said Lee.Singapore’s tougher moves signal its current approach -- relying on contact tracing, strict containment measures such as shutting bars, and quarantine -- is no longer tenable. While more than 160 countries have already shut schools, the city-state was one of a handful that did not do so, citing early research that children are not as affected as adults.Here are other details of the stricter measures:Casinos, theme parks to close starting next week.Food establishments, markets and supermarkets, clinics, hospitals, utilities, transport and key banking services will remain open.From April 7, all restaurants, hawker centers, coffee shops, food courts and other food-and-beverage outlets will remain open only for takeaway or delivery.Other economic sectors “that are strategic, or form part of a global supply chain” will not be closed.All preschool and student care centers will be closed, but will provide limited services for children of parents who have to continue working and are unable to make alternative arrangements.Government will stop discouraging the general public from wearing face masks in public, and will distribute reusable masks from April 5.The government also plans on Monday to announce more support aimed at businesses and households. Singapore delivered a second stimulus package worth S$48 billion ($33.4 billion) last week to fight the outbreak, drawing on national reserves for the first time since the global financial crisis to support an economy heading for recession.“Even if more assistance measures are announced on Monday, they are unlikely to offset the economic ramifications of what is akin to an economic immobilization,” Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore, said in an email. Retail sales plunged 8.6% in February from the same time last year, marking the worst decrease since June and the 13th consecutive decline.‘Very Worrying’ TrendsLee said the spirit of these measures is to get people to minimize physical contact. “If we don’t go out, if we avoid contact with others, then the virus won’t be able to spread. It is as simple as that,” he said.Lawrence Wong, minister for national development who co-chairs a task force to fight the virus, said in a press conference the increase in the number of local and unlinked coronavirus cases are “very, very worrying trends.”The latest set of moves will continue for at least a month, Wong said, adding there’s a chance the government can roll back the measures by the end of the month if the guidelines are upheld. He said the key objective is to reduce the spread of the virus, particularly cutting the number of unlinked cases.“If there’s poor compliance, poor implementation, then we have to be prepared for these measures to continue,” Wong said. “Let’s hunker down and beat the virus together.”Singapore announced Friday a fifth person has died due to complications from the coronavirus. Cases have risen more sharply in March compared to earlier months, and now total more than 1,000.Health Minister Gan said the city-state has yet to reach its highest level of alert, so-called Dorscon Red, and would press on with contact-tracing and widespread efforts to contain the disease. “We’re not yet in Dorscon Red, and we’re quite a distance from Dorscon Red,” he said.(Updates to add detail on prior approach in first, fourth paragraphs)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=\"all\">", "date": "Fri, 03 Apr 2020 08:42:37 -0400", "categories": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"], "source": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"], "sentiment": "positive"}

Suddenly, the protests in Hong Kong, carrying a mortal threat to political stability in the mainland, became a physical impossibility. More important, the pandemic set in motion a global competition, to contain the virus, for which China and the Chinese Communist Party seem uniquely prepared.As the virus spread to the whole world, it became apparent that Western societies — Beijing’s true rivals — did not have the ability to quickly organize every citizen around a single goal. As opposed to China, which remains to a large extent a revolutionary society, their political systems were built for normal times. Chinese society is a mobilized army, which can quickly drop everything else and march in one direction.Mao once said, “Everything under heaven is in utter chaos, the situation is excellent.” And so it seems at present, as seen from Beijing. Chinese diplomats stationed all over the world spend their time raising the stakes to a dangerous level. Following instructions from the very top, they have taken to the media to issue a challenge to America, to point out its failure, and to compare the chaos in American cities and hospitals with what they see as a singular success in stopping the epidemic in China.Several commentators have suggested that China may be winning the coronavirus battle by stepping forward in providing medical help to affected countries, mostly in Europe, at a time when the United States is consumed with its own difficulties. This misses the point.The cases have been multiplying where the medical equipment provided by Chinese companies and even the Chinese state turned out to be faulty, provoking justified ire in, for example, Spain, the Netherlands, and Turkey. Moreover, medical help is a normal occurrence in a crisis. China has done nothing different, except perhaps in the clumsy way it publicizes those efforts.Forget about “mask diplomacy.” It is no more than a distraction. There are other ways for China to use the coronavirus pandemic to upturn the existing global order. I see three main levers.The first one is the direct comparison between the situation in China and elsewhere. The numbers of cases and fatalities provided by Chinese authorities almost certainly misrepresent the real figures by more than an order of magnitude, but the fact remains that a semblance of normalcy was achieved in a small period of time. If the United States fails to do the same, its prestige will suffer a severe blow. People all over the world will quickly change their perceptions about relative power and capacity.The second lever resides with industrial value chains. Last month General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler closed all their automotive production plants across the United States and Canada. Other sectors have followed. In the meantime, China contained the worst of the pandemic to one province, allowing economic activity to quickly resume elsewhere. The most recent data show renewed activity in the flow of goods across the country, as well as at ports worldwide that do business with China. If the freeze in Europe and America continues for much longer, Chinese companies will be able to dramatically expand market share and replace Western-led value chains. Just yesterday Chinese authorities announced that manufacturing activity expanded in March, defying expectations of a contraction. In February the official Purchasing Managers’ Index hit a record low of 35.7. It bounced back to 52.0 in March. Prepare for a worldwide wave of Chinese acquisitions at knockdown prices.Finally, in a more extreme scenario, important countries could experience the kind of economic shock that leads to widespread social and political collapse. At that point, China would have a unique opportunity to step in, provide aid, and refashion these countries in its image. It would look like a repeat of the Marshall Plan and the beginning of the American world order after the ravages of World War II. Indonesia, South Asia, and even Russia might be of special interest in such a scenario.We knew that a generalized race or competition between alternative geopolitical models had started, but it was never clear what the background for such a competition would be.

Kushner, recently put in charge of a parallel coronavirus panel working on supply lines, criticized governors who don&#39;t know how many masks and ventilators they have in store.&quot;What a lot of the voters are seeing now is that when you elect somebody to be a mayor or governor or president, you&#39;re trying to think about who will be a competent manager during the time of crisis,&quot; Kushner said. &quot;This is a time of crisis, and you&#39;re seeing certain people are better managers than others.&quot;&gt; &quot;The states should know how many ventilators they have in their state…This is a time of crisis, and you&#39;re seeing certain people are better managers than others.” -Jared Kushnerpic.twitter.com/ojVEbpqplB&gt; &gt; — GOP (@GOP) April 3, 2020Kushner, 39, has criticized New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) in internal White House meetings over the past week, saying Cuomo is being alarmist about shortfalls in ventilators and other equipment, Gabriel Sherman reports at Vanity Fair. &quot;I have all this data about ICU capacity,&quot; Kushner said, according to a person at the meeting. &quot;I&#39;m doing my own projections, and I&#39;ve gotten a lot smarter about this. New York doesn&#39;t need all the ventilators.&quot; Kushner also reportedly bragged last month, &quot;I know how to make this government run now.&quot;So far, voters seem more impressed with the competence of their governors than Trump&#39;s. An Associated Press/NORC poll conducted March 26-29 found that 57 percent of Americans approve of their state government&#39;s coronavirus response, versus 44 percent who approved of Trump&#39;s response and 38 percent the federal government&#39;s response. &quot;In individual states, governors — most of whom are briefing the media and their residents on a daily basis — have seen their approval ratings shoot through the roof,&quot; Reid Wilson reports at The Hill.&gt; icymi&gt; &gt; Navigating Coronavirus: Public Looks to Dr. Fauci (@NavigatorSurvey) COVID19Pandemic Details: https://t.co/GAy2dHyMsR pic.twitter.com/2Kx79j3ZoV&gt; &gt; — OpinionToday.com (@OpinionToday) April 2, 2020As for Kushner, who&#39;s now &quot;making life-or-death decisions for all Americans,&quot; he has &quot;succeeded at exactly three things in his life,&quot; Michelle Goldberg writes in a New York Times op-ed. &quot;He was born to the right parents, married well, and learned how to influence his father-in-law.

{"title": "How Amazon turned Simon Stålenhag’s ‘Tales from the Loop’ into a TV show", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/amazon-tales-from-the-loop-simon-stalenhag-making-of-140005163.html", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-03/aeea6a60-7369-11ea-af6d-e98122921d9c\" /><p>Simon Stålenhag isn't a household name. But if you like robots and Scandinavian design, you've probably seen his work <a href=\"https://simonstalenhag.tumblr.com/\">on the internet</a>. The Swedish artist, musician and designer is known for producing images that combine rural or suburban life with flashes of science fiction. One picture shows <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/AN01pD7.jpg\">two teenagers in a snowy field</a>, throwing a red pole at some drones that wandered too close. Another <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/hAjZsN7.jpg\">depicts a solitary car</a> and, in the distance, a massive bipedal robot with wiry tendrils that connect to hundreds of people on the ground wearing ominous headsets.</p><p>Now, these drawings have been turned into a TV show.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Tales from the Loop</em>, which premiered on Amazon Prime Video today, shares the same name as <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cabinetentertainment/simon-stalenhags-tales-from-the-loop\">Stålenhag's first artbook</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192053011/tales-from-the-loop-roleplaying-in-the-80s-that-ne\">paper and pen role-playing game</a> Kickstarted in 2016. These publications provide an optional but fascinating explanation for the fantastical elements in the drawings. The RPG also provides a blueprint, through well-written \"mysteries'' (the game's version of quests) and stereotypical high school characters, to create some tabletop adventures inspired by <em>The Goonies</em>, <em>E.T.</em>, and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-30-stranger-things-3-review.html\">Netflix's <em>Stranger Things</em></a>. </p><p>Amazon's adaptation isn't set in Sweden, though, or anywhere else in Europe for that matter. It's also not an upbeat adventure about kids defying their parents and saving the world from an overly-ambitious government outfit. Surprisingly, it's a collection of stories that feel like melancholic art films. They have Stålenhag's iconic imagery peppered throughout, but the tone is noticeably slower and more thoughtful than most sci-fi shows. Think <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-11-black-mirror-season-five-review.html\"><em>Black Mirror</em></a> or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-29-twilight-zone-cbs-all-access-renewed-second-season.html\"><em>The Twilight Zone</em></a>, but with a less sinister or terrifying twist. A better point of comparison is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2013-08-07-her-spike-jonze-trailer.html\"><em>Her</em></a>, a romantic movie directed by Spike Jonze. While technology plays a major role in the film, it's more of a prompt or lens to explore how human relationships can change over time.</p><iframe width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1htuNZp82Ck\" allowfullscreen=\"false\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><p>The Amazon TV show was conceived by Nathaniel Halpern, a writer and producer who worked on <em>Legion</em>, a mind-bending depiction of Marvel's mutant antihero David Charles Haller. Halpern has never read the crowdfunded RPG book. The show does have a titular loop buried beneath the ground, similar to the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva, Switzerland. But in at least some of the episodes (curiously, Amazon gave critics episode one, four and six to review) there's no mention of the loops that Stålenhag envisioned in the Swedish countryside and Boulder City, Nevada. Other RPG omissions include the magnetrine effect, which allows cargo and military vehicles to float, or Riksenergi, a Swedish government agency that built the world's largest loop.</p><p>Instead, Halpern created some new lore.</p><p>The show revolves around a secretive loop facility in Ohio run by the Mercer Center for Experimental Physics. Early on, the director of this organization explains that the facility, and the experiments run within, make the seemingly impossible, well, possible. According to Halpern, Stålenhag was \"very supportive\" of the location shift. “He wanted these stories to be personal for me in the way that the paintings and landscape are personal for him,\" the writer told Engadget. </p><p>Like the RPG book, the loop is a MacGuffin that allows almost anything to happen inside the show. The townsfolk remain the same, but each episode focuses on a different character and their experience with the structure or one of its many fictional effects. Halpern took this approach after carefully examining Stålenhag's original artwork. He loved the emotion in his drawings and how the alternate-reality world felt very \"lived in.\" The far-out technology felt like an accepted and integrated part of everyday life, rather than something alien or surprising.</p><blockquote>  <p>“He wanted these stories to be personal for me in the way that the paintings and landscape are for him.\"</p> </blockquote><p>“They’re taken for granted more often than not,\" he explained. \"They just exist in the landscape and [have] a mundane, clunky quality. I’m a big fan of science fiction, but so often I find that the science fiction elements are fetishized like shiny toys, and the characters of the world take a bit of a back seat. But here it’s just there and taken for granted. There’s an exciting level of reality that’s created because it’s not being shown off. It’s just there and I think that’s rather unique.\"</p><section data-eng-breakout=\"5e836da1b307d08fe76d6ba7\" data-eng-breakout-type=\"e2ehero\"> <img class=\"e2ehero-url\" data-eng-breakout-field=\"img_url\" alt=\"Tales from the Loop\" data-eng-required=\"true\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-03/524fae30-736b-11ea-95cf-2d949892477b\" /> </section><p>Halpern tried to replicate that human-technology relationship in the show. Like Stålenhag's art, the loop in Ohio uses three massive cooling towers. They're visible in the background of countless shots but never questioned or explored up close. A floating tractor is treated the same way in episode six. Though it plays a critical role in the story, its ability to hover is simply accepted in the world. None of the characters gasp or run away when they see it hovering in a field.</p><p>Like Stålenhag's drawings, the show is set predominantly in the 1980s. Or at least, it seems to be. Unlike <em>Stranger Things</em>, the show isn't packed with obvious pop culture references that give the exact year away. Every room isn't littered with Star Wars memorabilia or original NES cartridges, for instance. And the show isn't crammed with iconic tunes like the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> movies. Instead, the historical nods are more subtle. You can approximate the time period based on the clothes that people are wearing, the cars they drive and the appliances in their suburban homes.</p><p>Halpern said: \"I didn’t want to fetishize the time period and say, 'Look at these clothes from the early 1980s!' Or, 'Do you remember this?' I didn’t want that element of nostalgia [in the show].”</p><p>It's unusually difficult to pinpoint the exact year that most of the drama takes place, though. The homes in Ohio, for instance, often feature objects from a few different decades. You might theorize that the show is set in 1982, only to see a typewriter or rotary phone that feels closer to the 1960s or 70s. It's a departure from Stålenhag's art, but an intentional one. Halpern wanted the show to have a \"timeless quality\" that reinforced the show's own history. The household objects are supposed to be a visual reminder and representation of prior generations that lived in Ohio.</p><p>\"They show that it’s not just the stamp of right now, but there’s much from the past that carries forward,\" he explained.</p><figure><img src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-03/f03b6260-736b-11ea-beff-4ba75d9e8283\" alt=\"Tales from the Loop\" credit=\"Amazon\" creditUrl=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" data-ops=\"\" /> <figcaption>The costume design is a curious blend of American and European influences.</figcaption> <div class=\"photo-credit\">Amazon</div> </figure><p>The writer didn't abandon the Scandinavian aesthetic entirely, either. The main family in the show drives a decades-old Volvo, for instance, and often wears jackets and knitted sweaters that feel more European than American. Halpern justified these touchstones through the scientific community that has traveled from across the globe to work at the loop facility. \"So while, yes, it is [depicting] America, it is kind of an aesthetic unto itself,” the writer said.</p><p>The show's visual language compliments the one-shot episode format. One story grapples with time travel, however that mechanic isn't revealed until the final act. The timeless aesthetic therefore helps to mask the fantastical element, though it's still possible to guess what's happening through dialog and character reactions. Another episode involves the death of a major loop employee. In one scene, two characters step inside a mysterious structure that, through a series of echoes, can reveal how long you have left to live. Later, the employee chooses a relative as their successor, indicating that life is cyclical and the choices we make echo forward through time.</p><p>\"It goes back to that word timeless,\" Halpern said. \"And so much of the show is about our experience with time.”</p><p>Halpern hopes the self-contained stories evoke a sense of wonder. He felt the same emotion while looking at Stålenhag's artwork and worried that any single loop effect would lose its intrigue over an eight-episode season. “It becomes a little too normal,” Halpern said. That's why each episode tackles a wildly different idea. The breadth keeps the show fresh and ensures the viewer is never certain what the rules and narrative boundaries are. “There’s always something new if you keep watching,\" Halpern hinted. \"And I think that’s what I was chasing, ultimately. Just never losing that sense of wonder.”</p><blockquote>  <p>“So much of the show is about our experience with time.”</p> </blockquote><p>The show does have story beats that evolve and carry over between episodes, though. So if you watch the entire season you'll gain a deeper appreciation for the cast. In episode one, for instance, you might think the loop's security guard is a throwaway character. By the end of the show, though, you'll know more about him and view his earlier mannerisms differently.</p><section data-eng-breakout=\"5e836ffbb307d08fe76d6c0c\" data-eng-breakout-type=\"e2ehero\"> <img class=\"e2ehero-url\" data-eng-breakout-field=\"img_url\" alt=\"Tales from the Loop\" data-eng-required=\"true\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-03/bdef4be0-736c-11ea-bfd7-11c0c71265b7\" /> </section><p>“The outcomes of these stories ripple forward,\" Halpern explained. \"So someone that’s watching the whole season can see, 'Oh, this person’s connected to that person. Or this person doesn’t know what happened to that person.’ You really start to get immersed in a portrait of a town where there are no extras and everyone can step forward and have their story told.”</p><p>Most of the episodes have a quiet and contemplative tone. Again, this was meant to emulate Halpern's paintings, which rarely depict blockbuster action or life-threatening danger. The writer thought it would be wrong to create a show with a looming threat like the Mind Flayer from Netflix's <em>Stranger Things</em>. A better approach, he thought, would be to focus on the moments \"in-between incidents.\" Halpern said: “So often in the genre, the idea or the science fiction concept can swallow up everything else and it becomes solely about that. Because science fiction is so powerful and can get your mind working. But how do you use just the right amount so [the episode] remains a character piece?”</p><section data-eng-breakout=\"5e8374f7b307d08fe76d6f37\" data-eng-breakout-type=\"aside\"> <img class=\"aside-url\" data-eng-breakout-field=\"aside_img_url\" alt=\"Tales from the Loop\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-03/bd3cbd60-736f-11ea-b7ef-a6d9fddaca99\" /> <p class=\"aside-credit\" data-eng-breakout-field=\"credit\">Amazon</p> </section><p>It was a hard balance to strike. With each new fantastical element, it's only natural for people to speculate about its origins. Halpern has an explanation for everything in the show but he rarely offers them to the viewer. That's because Tales from the Loop isn't supposed to be Lost, Westworld, or any other show that uses mysteries to keep viewers hooked. </p><p>“It’s about a feeling and experiencing this with these characters and being there with them,\" Halpern said. \"Because I find that more often than not, as soon as you answer a question, there’s another question and another question. Some people find that very stimulating and like to watch things that way. I just don’t happen to be one of them. So I just went in the opposite direction, which means it’s there if you want to think about it, but it’s not a mystery show, because I felt that would take away from the emotion.”</p><p>Most series, for instance, keep their top-secret government facility at a distance. They're conceived as the final lair or battleground for a group of plucky but under-resourced heroes. <em>Tales from the Loop</em> invites you inside straight away, though, and reveals the mystical Eclipse that produces the otherworldly effects. It's a startling move that delivers a clear message to the viewer: 'Here's the MacGuffin. This show isn't about how or why the townsfolk are experiencing so many supernatural phenomena.'</p><figure><img src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-03/f206b710-736c-11ea-beff-f519e51215eb\" alt=\"Tales from the Loop\" credit=\"Amazon\" creditUrl=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" data-ops=\"\" /> <figcaption>The supernatural Eclipse that powers the loop.</figcaption> <div class=\"photo-credit\">Amazon</div> </figure><p>\"I didn’t want people distracted by what’s underground and just wanting to get to that,\" Halpern said. \"So that was really the mountain to climb at the beginning, which is, 'What does the loop look like? What does the core of it, the Eclipse, look like?' Revealing that in the first episode took the question off the table and lets the audience know this isn’t a mystery show where you’re wondering what’s happening behind a closed door.\"</p><p>The writing is only one part of the show's construction. Amazon used a company called <a href=\"https://www.rodeofx.com/\">Rodeo FX</a> to create the technology and loop effects that don't yet exist in our reality. The specialist studio has worked on blockbuster movies such as <em>Arrival</em>, <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>, <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em>, <em>Blade Runner 2049</em> and <em>Godzilla: King of the Monsters</em>, as well as countless TV shows including Amazon hits <em>The Boys</em> and <em>Jack Ryan</em>.</p><p>Robert Bock and Julien Hery worked as VFX supervisors on <em>Tales from the Loop</em>. Bock worked closely with Amazon while Hery led the project internally at Rodeo FX. The latter hadn't heard of Stålenhag before working on the show, however the company's concept artists were already familiar and the team's animation lead had played the book-based RPG.</p><p>At its peak, Rodeo FX had roughly 40 people working on the show. To complete the project, the company's CGI, compositing and asset-building teams used a range of industry-standard software including Autodesk Maya, ZBrush, Nuke, Houdini, Katana and Arnold.</p><blockquote>  <p>“The team produced more than two hours of VFX work across the eight-episode season.”</p> </blockquote><p>The company was flexible and tweaked its artistic approach depending on the episode and desired visual effect. In the first episode, for instance, there's a silent robot standing in a forest. According to Hery, the show's production team created a real-life version of the machine with some basic puppeteering controls. Some movements required visual effects, though, so Rodeo FX had to scan and recreate the prop digitally. “It was based on really great references,\" Hery said. \"We had [Stålenhag's] book, but we also had an on-set build.”</p><section data-eng-breakout=\"5e837147b307d08fe76d6dbe\" data-eng-breakout-type=\"e2ehero\"> <img class=\"e2ehero-url\" data-eng-breakout-field=\"img_url\" alt=\"Tales from the Loop\" data-eng-required=\"true\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-03/7c664c90-736d-11ea-bffe-0e521c464b76\" /> </section><p>There's another robot in the show with an orange paint job. The production team didn't create a physical prop for this one, so Rodeo FX had to come up with its own digital version from scratch. The android is from one of Stålenhag's most famous paintings, which also serves as the cover for the original <em>Tales from the Loop</em> artbook. It's only ever shown from behind, though, so the team had to envision the front on its own. A drawing doesn't move, either, so Rodeo FX dreamt up the machine's skeleton --where its joints are, and how far they can flex -- and range of movements. \"You have lot of interpretation,\" Hery said.</p><p>In general, there were two aesthetic qualities that Rodeo FX tried to follow with its visual effects work. First, the technology needed to be grounded in reality, or at least obey real-world physics. A robot shouldn't be able to leap over a building, for instance, unless it has enormous rockets or thrusters somewhere. Secondly, the digital objects had to look a little mundane. They could be colorful, just like Stalenghag's original artwork, but the paintwork needed to be muted to convey that these are normal and unsurprising parts of the landscape. \"Not fancy and modern,\" Hery said.</p><section data-eng-breakout=\"5e837598b307d08fe76d6f93\" data-eng-breakout-type=\"aside\"> <img class=\"aside-url\" data-eng-breakout-field=\"aside_img_url\" alt=\"Tales from the Loop\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-03/183b43d0-7370-11ea-bbff-8525575f71c1\" /> <p class=\"aside-credit\" data-eng-breakout-field=\"credit\">Amazon</p> </section><p>In total, Rodeo FX helped with roughly 700 shots in the show. The melancholic pacing was \"a pretty big challenge,\" according to the VFX supervisor, because many of the final shots were over two minutes long. “We’re more used to a VFX shot being something like four seconds,” Hery explained. In the end, the team produced more than two hours of VFX work across the eight-episode season. \"Which, when you think about it, is pretty insane data-wise,\" he added. \"Even compared to a feature film, that's a lot.\"</p><p>Ultimately, the show doesn't try to imitate Stålenhag's painterly style. It's not like Undone, another Amazon exclusive, which used rotoscoping to create a true animation and live-action hybrid. Like Halpern's writing, the visual effects are meant to capture the essence of Stålenhag's work, rather than replicate its style and book-based lore precisely. </p><p>For some, that will be a disappointment. They'll miss the European setting and want more of the <em>Goonies</em>-esque hijinks portrayed in the RPG book. Amazon, however, has done its best to create something new. Instead of mere imitation, it's tried to craft a show that is faithful to the source material and packed with new ideas -- narratively, visually and musically -- that justify its own existence. As far as Halpern is concerned, the show delivers on that difficult but worthwhile ambition. \"It all worked in concert beautifully,\" he said. \"And it created a world that feels very real and visceral, and like a place you could actually visit, which was my goal.”</p><iframe width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v6rbK3H-BOU\" allowfullscreen=\"false\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t", "date": "Fri, 03 Apr 2020 10:00:05 -0400", "categories": ["amazon", "amazon prime video", "art", "entertainment", "feature", "rodeo fx", "sci-fi", "science fiction", "simon stalenhag"], "source": "Engadget RSS Feed", "sentiment": "positive"}

They believe it&#39;s the first piece of clothing that can be used for cancer prevention. They even claim that it&#39;s comfortable and that the tech is &quot;nearly imperceptible.&quot;</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Unlike mammograms, which use low-energy x-rays, the <a href=\"https://actu.epfl.ch/news/a-smart-bra-for-detecting-early-stage-breast-cance/\">SmartBra</a> uses ultrasound waves, which are generated by piezoelectric sensors embedded in the bra. Those run on energy generated when pressure is applied to a piezoelectric material, and they allowed the students to miniaturize the technology. The team also developed a plastic interface to replace the gel that is typically used during ultrasounds.</p>\n\n<p>The students, working with startup <a href=\"https://icosamed.com/\">IcosaMed</a>, hope to bring the SmartBra to market in 2021. First, they plan to sell it to patients who have already been diagnosed and might benefit from daily monitoring. Then, they&#39;ll market the SmartBra to people who are genetically predisposed to developing cancer, and eventually it might be sold to anyone who is interested.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if the SmartBra detects a suspicious mass, it will alert the wearer so they can follow up with a specialist. In the future, the team hopes it might be used as a complementary or alternative therapy.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We hope that one day it could also act preventively and emit nearly continuous, low-dose ultrasound waves in a controlled manner so as to stimulate apoptosis in the cancerous mass,&quot; said Max Boysset, IcosaMed founder and CEO.</p>\n\n<p>This is still very much a proof of concept, but the idea is promising. We&#39;ve seen a lot of big tech companies using AI to help diagnose early-stage breast cancer. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-01-googles-ai-can-detect-breast-cancer-more-accurately-than-expert.html\">Google</a> claims its AI can detect breast cancer more accurately than experts. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-07-mit-ai-model-breast-cancer.html\">MIT</a> says its AI is free of racial bias, and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-18-ibm-ai-predicts-breast-cancer.html\">IBM</a> boasts that its AI method can predict breast cancer years before it appears. All of those methods, though, use mammograms, making the SmartBra that much more novel.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t", "date": "Fri, 03 Apr 2020 09:51:00 -0400", "categories": ["breast cancer", "cancer", "clothing", "detection", "epfl", "gear", "icosamed", "medicine", "piezoelectric", "prevention", "smart bra", "smart clothing", "smartbra", "students", "switzerland", "ultrasound", "wearable", "wearables", "womens health"], "source": "Engadget RSS Feed", "sentiment": "negative"}

Suddenly, the protests in Hong Kong, carrying a mortal threat to political stability in the mainland, became a physical impossibility. More important, the pandemic set in motion a global competition, to contain the virus, for which China and the Chinese Communist Party seem uniquely prepared.As the virus spread to the whole world, it became apparent that Western societies — Beijing’s true rivals — did not have the ability to quickly organize every citizen around a single goal. As opposed to China, which remains to a large extent a revolutionary society, their political systems were built for normal times. Chinese society is a mobilized army, which can quickly drop everything else and march in one direction.Mao once said, “Everything under heaven is in utter chaos, the situation is excellent.” And so it seems at present, as seen from Beijing. Chinese diplomats stationed all over the world spend their time raising the stakes to a dangerous level. Following instructions from the very top, they have taken to the media to issue a challenge to America, to point out its failure, and to compare the chaos in American cities and hospitals with what they see as a singular success in stopping the epidemic in China.Several commentators have suggested that China may be winning the coronavirus battle by stepping forward in providing medical help to affected countries, mostly in Europe, at a time when the United States is consumed with its own difficulties. This misses the point.The cases have been multiplying where the medical equipment provided by Chinese companies and even the Chinese state turned out to be faulty, provoking justified ire in, for example, Spain, the Netherlands, and Turkey. Moreover, medical help is a normal occurrence in a crisis. China has done nothing different, except perhaps in the clumsy way it publicizes those efforts.Forget about “mask diplomacy.” It is no more than a distraction. There are other ways for China to use the coronavirus pandemic to upturn the existing global order. I see three main levers.The first one is the direct comparison between the situation in China and elsewhere. The numbers of cases and fatalities provided by Chinese authorities almost certainly misrepresent the real figures by more than an order of magnitude, but the fact remains that a semblance of normalcy was achieved in a small period of time. If the United States fails to do the same, its prestige will suffer a severe blow. People all over the world will quickly change their perceptions about relative power and capacity.The second lever resides with industrial value chains. Last month General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler closed all their automotive production plants across the United States and Canada. Other sectors have followed. In the meantime, China contained the worst of the pandemic to one province, allowing economic activity to quickly resume elsewhere. The most recent data show renewed activity in the flow of goods across the country, as well as at ports worldwide that do business with China. If the freeze in Europe and America continues for much longer, Chinese companies will be able to dramatically expand market share and replace Western-led value chains. Just yesterday Chinese authorities announced that manufacturing activity expanded in March, defying expectations of a contraction. In February the official Purchasing Managers’ Index hit a record low of 35.7. It bounced back to 52.0 in March. Prepare for a worldwide wave of Chinese acquisitions at knockdown prices.Finally, in a more extreme scenario, important countries could experience the kind of economic shock that leads to widespread social and political collapse. At that point, China would have a unique opportunity to step in, provide aid, and refashion these countries in its image. It would look like a repeat of the Marshall Plan and the beginning of the American world order after the ravages of World War II. Indonesia, South Asia, and even Russia might be of special interest in such a scenario.We knew that a generalized race or competition between alternative geopolitical models had started, but it was never clear what the background for such a competition would be. If the clash took place within the existing global trade and financial system, which was of course built according to Western rules and principles, the United States was confident the battle could be decisively won. But what if it took place on neutral ground? What if it took place in a kind of neutral landscape, a state of nature with few or no rules, against a chaotic and quickly evolving background? The outcome would become considerably more uncertain.To put it more bluntly: There was always an argument that the existing world order cannot change because only a momentous war has done that in the past and world wars have become impossible. But in pandemics — and soon in climate change — we may have found two functional equivalents of war.<p><br clear=\"all\">", "date": "Fri, 03 Apr 2020 06:30:22 -0400", "categories": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"], "source": ["Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines"], "sentiment": "positive"}

But if you own a Max, you might want to keep it handy. The 360 camera is getting a firmware update that adds a few features that were missing at launch. Most notably the addition of a 60fps recording option for 360 videos, and spherical video and time lapse modes.</p><p>When GoPro unveiled Max, it solved a lot of the issues we had with Fusion — the company's first stab at a 360-camera. Not only was it smaller, the user experience was much improved and a slew of new features like Max HyperSmooth and 360 TimeWarp added exciting creative options. But a few things were notable by their absence. There was no slow-motion at all, and 360 time lapse options were limited to TimeWarp (which is conceptually similar but less apt for higher quality photos).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>With the new firmware, you'll finally have some form of slow motion in 360 mode, albeit just 60fps (2x). There is a trade off in resolution, too, as you'll have to shoot in 3K. This might sound a lot, but given Max is essentially two cameras, it's a relative step down from the standard 5.6K (stitched) image available at 30 fps. </p><figure><img src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/3b4dda40-759b-11ea-bbfd-4bd3b698b197\" alt=\"GoPro Max update.\" credit=\"James Trew / Engadget\" creditUrl=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" data-ops=\"\" /> <figcaption /> <div class=\"photo-credit\">James Trew / Engadget</div> </figure><p>The addition of time lapse in 360 mode fills a glaring gap in the Max spec sheet. When <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-22-gopro-max-review.html\">I reviewed the camera</a>, I enjoyed the presence of TimeWarp, but was disappointed there was no conventional time lapse mode in 360 (you could shoot regular “flat” time lapses). Not only is it a popular feature generally, but it's also a handy way to take multiple photos without having to manually click the shutter -- if you want to catch a moving target or have multiple shots (okay, selfies) to choose from. Which interval options will be available isn't clear right now, but we're hoping there's a decent selection.</p><p>Other perks in the update include Horizon levelling for TimeWarp and photos (in non-360 mode) as well as improved media offload speeds. There's only one small caveat, and that's that you'll have to wait a little longer. The update is currently due to land around April 15th, but we guess it's not like you're planning on going on any adventures right now.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t", "date": "Fri, 03 Apr 2020 09:02:31 -0400", "categories": ["action camera", "gear", "news", "0", "gopro", "max", "time lapse"], "source": "Engadget RSS Feed", "sentiment": "negative"}

The site in Sheffield — the only permanent museum dedicated to video game culture in the UK — is one of many brick-and-mortar businesses that have been forced to close their doors during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The safety of staff and visitors is, of course, NVM&#39;s top priority. Turning off the lights has meant shutting off the museum&#39;s primary source of revenue, though: admission fees.</p>\n\n<p>In response, NVM has furloughed roughly two thirds of its 18 employees. That means most staff have stopped working and accepted a pay packet, funded by the UK government, that will cover up to 80 percent of their usual wages. Even a small skeleton crew isn&#39;t enough to balance the museum&#39;s finances, though. Iain Simons, the museum&#39;s director of culture and a long-time writer and speaker about video games, estimates that NVM has enough in the bank to last &quot;a few months.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>If it can&#39;t reopen or find additional funding, it&#39;s possible the museum will close for good.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a depressing fate that management is obviously keen to avoid. Last week, the museum <a href=\"https://justgiving.com/campaign/savethenvmuk\">set up a JustGiving page</a> with an £80,000 (roughly $99,385) target. At the time of writing, a little more than 350 people have donated £29,323 (roughly $35,999) to the cause. Simons hopes that the target amount can keep the museum afloat until it officially re-opens. No one is exactly sure how long the quarantine will last, though — not even the UK government. That&#39;s why NVM management is also reaching out to members of the video game industry and existing museum patrons.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Money buys time and people, really,&quot; Simons said.</p>\n\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FQ3ymyrFniw\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>The situation might be different if NVM was an accredited museum. It&#39;s a legitimate business, backed up by a charity called the <a href=\"http://thebgi.uk/\">British Games Institute</a> (BGI), but it&#39;s still working on the accreditation that would potentially unlock funding from Arts Council England and other UK government schemes.</p>\n\n<p>The &quot;small skeleton crew&quot; that hasn&#39;t been furloughed will be focused on this all important kitemark, as well developing &quot;what the museum will be when we reopen, and obviously fundraising,&quot; Simons explained.</p>\n\n<p>The timing of the coronavirus pandemic couldn&#39;t be worse.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"half-width right\">\n<p>&quot;You haven&#39;t got to be an epidemiologist to work out that we&#39;re one of the higher risk spaces.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Before COVID-19 reached Britain&#39;s shores, the museum was apparently flourishing. NVM had experienced its &quot;busiest half term ever&quot; in mid-February, according to Simons. &quot;Just over a month ago, everyone was basically still outside having a brilliant time,&quot; he explained. There wasn&#39;t a huge drop-off in the weekends that followed, either. NVM was aware of COVID-19, though, and took some common sense precautions. &quot;Obviously, we were cleaning more, and we were doing all the things you&#39;d expect us to do,&quot; Simons said.</p>\n\n<p>That same month, though, the UK recorded <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51683428\">its first internal transmission of COVID-19</a>. &quot;Fairly suddenly, things escalated in the UK,&quot; Simons said. NVM knew it would need to take action quickly. The museum, which sits inside Sheffield&#39;s Castle House, is packed with consoles and arcade cabinets. Hundreds of sticks and buttons are touched by an assortment of strangers every day. Even the most rigorous cleaning schedule wouldn&#39;t be enough to stop the spread of a virus like COVID-19. &quot;You haven&#39;t got to be an epidemiologist to work out that we&#39;re one of the higher risk spaces,&quot; Smith added.</p>\n\n<p>NVM stopped admissions on March 16th, a week before UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">issued a nationwide lockdown</a>. &quot;I think we were one of the first museums to do that,&quot; Simon said. &quot;That was the right call, I think.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"National Videogame Museum\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dimse/5845cadfecd996e0372f/7317b3945a20e1e054a458c49012f78416800c48/cmVzaXplPTIwMDAlMkMyMDAwJTJDc2hyaW5rJmltYWdlX3VyaT1odHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnMueWltZy5jb20lMkZvcyUyRmNyZWF0ci11cGxvYWRlZC1pbWFnZXMlMkYyMDIwLTA0JTJGY2IzYTMyZjAtNzRkMC0xMWVhLWJmZmEtYzI1Zjk3MWQ0MWE3JmNsaWVudD1hMWFjYWMzZTFiMzI5MDkxN2Q5MiZzaWduYXR1cmU9NDAwZjU0MGU3OGY2OTE2NDNhMTBmODkyNWEyODgxYjRiMzM1YTljOA==\"></p>\n\n<p>The museum is used to operating on the financial edge.</p>\n\n<p>The original museum, which was based in Nottingham <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-30-national-videogame-arcade.html\">and called the National Videogame Arcade</a> (NVA), opened in 2015 and almost went out of business the following year. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/16/national-videogame-arcade-nottingham-gaming-institution\"><em>The Guardian</em> reports</a>, the NVA was renting a large building and had 40 staff to pay. &quot;It became horribly clear, horribly suddenly, that we weren&#39;t going to be able to pay salaries,&quot; Simons told the newspaper in 2016.</p>\n\n<p>The team managed to attract investment, though, from Games Workshop founder Ian Livingstone and British developers including Sumo Digital (<em>Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed</em>, <em>Snake Pass</em>) and Playground Games (<em>Forza Horizon)</em>, among others. The funding also created the National Videogame Foundation, which oversaw both the NVA and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gamecity\">Nottingham-based GameCity Festival</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In February 2018, the Foundation merged with the newly-formed BGI. Seven months later, though, the organization was forced to move the arcade. &quot;The thing about Nottingham is that it was on five floors,&quot; Simons explained. &quot;There were lots of different rooms. It was like a badly designed Quake level of a museum. It was really, really exciting but incredibly difficult to run.&quot; When the Nottingham site closed, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-45360836\">Simons told <em>the BBC</em></a> that it could not be &quot;judged a commercial success.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;If you want an easy life, don&#39;t open a museum about video games,&quot; he told Engadget.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"National Videogame Museum\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dimse/5845cadfecd996e0372f/a8ebc47555656d92b0e4eb6f998b65d625b5c5e8/cmVzaXplPTIwMDAlMkMyMDAwJTJDc2hyaW5rJmltYWdlX3VyaT1odHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnMueWltZy5jb20lMkZvcyUyRmNyZWF0ci11cGxvYWRlZC1pbWFnZXMlMkYyMDIwLTA0JTJGNWNkZmQwMjAtNzRkMS0xMWVhLWJmZmYtM2Q0MDA4MjMxMDkwJmNsaWVudD1hMWFjYWMzZTFiMzI5MDkxN2Q5MiZzaWduYXR1cmU9ZGRjYTk1ODVlYWU2MmQ4OTdjZjY0MGRiOTkyMWZlM2JkOWEyY2RkMQ==\"></p>\n\n<p>The new location, which also introduced the National Videogame Museum name, is a single floor that can be easily reconfigured to accommodate new additions and exhibits. It&#39;s not the most luxurious space, and the organization doesn&#39;t have the money to create flashy exhibits like London&#39;s Science Museum or Design Museum. But it&#39;s got what&#39;s most important — a truckload of games spanning many different decades — and other interesting objects, including merchandise and design documents, that explain how tentpole titles impacted the industry and popular culture. &quot;You can play games at home,&quot; Simons said. &quot;What we&#39;re trying to do is bring the story of video game culture, beyond just the games, to the public.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>With the support of the BGI, the museum has apparently made great strides in the last year. &quot;We were getting to a point of stability,&quot; Simons said. &quot;and then guess what? This comes along.&quot; He is well aware, though, that a museum isn&#39;t the highest priority right now. Culture and game preservation is important, but people&#39;s health and financial security obviously come first. &quot;I&#39;m not suggesting for a second that the threat to the NVM is, in any way, comparative with what&#39;s actually going on out there in the street, or out there in the country in people&#39;s homes,&quot; Simons said.</p>\n\n<p>Still, it&#39;s a site that many would be sad to lose.</p>\n\n<p>Simons is upbeat about the situation, though. He&#39;s still thinking about the museum&#39;s long-term ambitions and how it can come back with a bang once the quarantine is lifted. &quot;At some point, [COVID-19] is going to be over,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re all going to go back outside. I guess I really want to make sure that we&#39;re there with new ideas and new ways to welcome people to the museum when we get to that.&quot; He&#39;s focused on the museum&#39;s survival, of course, but believes it&#39;s equally important that people think about the future. &quot;We need to be able to think in the hardest of times,&quot; he said. &quot;Being able to think positively about that is, I think, the real challenge.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>If you want to make a donation to the museum, <a href=\"https://justgiving.com/campaign/savethenvmuk\">you can do so here</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t", "date": "Fri, 03 Apr 2020 07:00:00 -0400", "categories": ["art", "business", "game preservation", "gaming", "museum", "national videogame museum", "nvm"], "source": "Engadget RSS Feed", "sentiment": "positive"}

Unlike <em>Blackout</em>, which required <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4</em>, <em>Warzone</em> is completely free-to-play. That decision has helped the battle royale newcomer rack up <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-20-call-of-duty-warzone-30-million-players-battle-royale.html\">more than 30 million players</a> -- a number that includes <em>Modern Warfare</em> participants -- and better compete with free-to-play alternatives including <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>PUBG</em>. <em>Modern Warfare</em> sales <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/30/20939810/modern-warfare-call-of-duty-sales-numbers\">have remained strong</a>, too -- so breaking off what could have been an exclusive mode (similar to <em>Blackout</em>) doesn’t see to have hurt Activision's annualization strategy, either.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If your Call of Duty appetite still isn't satisfied, there's also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-31-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-campaign-remastered-now-available-ps4.html\">the newly-launched <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> remaster</a>. The updated version of the largely-beloved 2009 campaign is currently available for $20 on the PlayStation Store. Xbox One and PC owners should get the same offering on April 30th.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t", "date": "Fri, 03 Apr 2020 04:42:03 -0400", "categories": ["call of duty", "cod", "gaming", "modern warfare", "news", "warzone"], "source": "Engadget RSS Feed", "sentiment": "positive"}
